# Explanation:
# Inheritance from Rectangle:
# The Square class inherits from Rectangle, which in turn inherits from BaseGeometry.
#
# Validation of size:
# size is validated using integer_validator to ensure it is a positive integer.
#
# Private Attribute:
# __size is private, and there are no getters or setters.
#
# Calling Rectangle’s Constructor (super()):
# Since a square is a special case of a rectangle where width and height are equal,
# we pass size as both width and height to the Rectangle constructor.
#
# Implemented area() Method:
# Computes and returns the square’s area (size * size).
