# Explanation:
# Uses the with statement:
# Ensures the file is properly closed after writing.
#
# Opens the file in write mode ("w"):
# Creates the file if it doesnâ€™t exist.
# Overwrites the content if the file already exists.
#
# Writes the text and returns the number of characters written:
# f.write(text) writes the string to the file and returns
# the number of characters.
