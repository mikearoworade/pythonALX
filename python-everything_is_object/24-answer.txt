The script prints: True

Explanation:
a = (1) and b = (1) are both just integers because (1) is not a tuple
(itâ€™s just 1 inside parentheses).

So, a and b both refer to the same integer 1 in memory.

In Python, small integers (usually between -5 and 256) are cached and reused,
so a is b evaluates to True.
