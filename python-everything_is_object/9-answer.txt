The line:
print(s1 is s2) # True

Explanation:

The is operator checks if two variables reference the same object in memory.

In Python, small strings and commonly used immutable objects (like "Best School")
are interned (stored in a shared memory location to optimize performance).

Since "Best School" is a simple string, Python might store both s1 and s2 in the
same memory location, making s1 is s2 return True
