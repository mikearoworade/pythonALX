The script prints: False

Explanation:
a = (1, 2) and b = (1, 2) are two separate tuple objects with the same values.

Unlike empty tuples, Python does not guarantee interning for non-empty tuples.

Since a and b are separate objects in memory, a is b evaluates to False.

However, a == b would return True because they have the same content.
