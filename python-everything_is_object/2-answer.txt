In Python, integers are immutable objects.

each variable is assigned a separate integer object in memory.
Since 89 and 100 are different values, Python creates two different objects for them.

You can confirm this by checking their id():

a = 89
b = 100
print(id(a))  # Memory address of a
print(id(b))  # Memory address of b (different from a)
