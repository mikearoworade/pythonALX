The script:
def increment(n):
    n += 1

a = 1
increment(a)
print(a) # 1

Explanation:
a = 1 â†’ a is assigned the value 1.

increment(a) is called with a (which is 1).

Inside the function:

n += 1 creates a new local variable n, which is incremented to 2.

However, this change only affects n inside the function and does not modify a outside the function.

After the function call, a remains 1 since integers are immutable in Python,
meaning n += 1 does not modify a itself.

print(a) prints 1.
