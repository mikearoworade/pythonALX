Yes.

Explanation:
a is initially a list:

a = [1, 2, 3]

The list a is stored at memory address 139926795932424.
id(a) confirms the memory address: 139926795932424

When you do:
a += [4]

This is equivalent to a.extend([4]).

It modifies the list in place instead of creating a new one.

Since the same list object is modified, id(a) remains unchanged.

Therefore, the last line will print 139926795932424.
