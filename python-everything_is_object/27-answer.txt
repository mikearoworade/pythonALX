No.

Explanation:
a is initially a list:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
The list a is stored at memory address 139926795932424.

When you do:
a = a + [5]

a + [5] creates a new list (it does not modify the original list in place).
a now points to this new list, which has a different memory address.

Since id(a) gives the memory address of the object a refers to, the last line
will not print 139926795932424. Instead, it will print the memory address of
the newly created list.
