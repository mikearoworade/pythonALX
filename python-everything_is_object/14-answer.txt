The script:
l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l2 = l1
l1.append(4)
print(l2) # [1, 2, 3, 4]

Explanation:
l1 and l2 refer to the same list object in memory (since l2 = l1).

When l1.append(4) is executed, it modifies the same list object that both l1 and l2 point to.

So when print(l2) is executed, it reflects the change made to l1, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 4].
