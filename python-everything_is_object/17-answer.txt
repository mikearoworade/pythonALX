The script:
def increment(n):
    n.append(4)

l = [1, 2, 3]
increment(l)
print(l) # [1, 2, 3, 4]

Explanation:
l = [1, 2, 3] â†’ l is a list.

increment(l) is called, passing l as an argument.

Inside the increment function:

n.append(4) modifies the same list object that l refers to.

Since lists are mutable, changes inside the function affect the original list.

After the function call, l has been modified to [1, 2, 3, 4].

print(l) prints [1, 2, 3, 4].
