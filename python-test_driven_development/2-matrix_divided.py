    Divides all elements of a matrix by a given number.

    Args:
        matrix (list of lists): A matrix (list of lists) of integers or floats.
        div (int or float): The number by which to divide each element of the matrix.

    Returns:
        list of lists: A new matrix with each element divided by div, rounded to 2 decimal places.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If matrix is not a list of lists of integers or floats.
        TypeError: If each row of the matrix is not of the same size.
        TypeError: If div is not a number (integer or float).
        ZeroDivisionError: If div is zero.
